# CSS-Color-Markers
A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with rgb value and hexadecimal or hex values. 

You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
